            Design Tech High School is a high school in Redwood Shores. It is on the Oracle campus and over 500 students go there for their education. The main draw to 
            it is the focus on design thinking that is taught to students. A typical day at the school consists of 6 period that include core classes, as well as a 
            FIT (focused indpendent time) or an elective that the students chose. There are not very many electives that are provided during normal school days: computer
            science, environmental science, and photography. Other elective courses are offered during a set of two weeks called "intersession". 
        </p>

        <h2>Core Classes</h2>
        <p>
            Each student has core classes that include: a math class on their level, a English class, a Science class, a language class (that isn't Engish), another class
            like history or econ, and a FIT that they could switch for an elective class.
        </p>

        <h2>Intersession</h2>
        <img src="../src/img/dtech/drg_dtech.jpg" width="50%" height="50%" class="leftImage">
        <p>
            Intersession is a dedicated where core classes do not occur, and students have two classes, a design lab which focuses on design thinking, and an exploration 
            class that provides lots of other classes offering things from mural painting to internships with companies. This website is a for a web design exploration 
            class that is offered during intersession. There are 4 intersessions that occur during the school year, 2 in each semester. Intersession ends up being either
            the favorite classes or the least favorites depending on the student and what classes they have. The classes are always different, since the explorations are
            always taught by people that are not normal dtech staff, so classes end up being more exciting or less so. Design Labs are taught by normal teachers, and 
            the classes specialize into a certain topic, allowing students to design a certain thing relating to the topic over the course of two weeks. Exploration 
            classes are taught by professionals from the industry, and are both good for an introduction to that industry, or allows students to go more in depth into
            that subject.

        <h2>School Building</h2>
        <img src="../src/img/dtech/dtech_image.jpg" width="25%" height="25%">
        <p>
            The school building is a two story building, and has roughly three types of areas in the school that students can work in. There are classrooms, breakout 
            rooms, and breakout spaces. Classrooms are the most standard, in a fully enclosed area and under the rule of a teacher. A breakout room is a small room that
            students can work in if they are in a small group and want their own area. Each room has three windows, and two classrooms border it, and the teacher from 
            the class can look in to make sure the students working there are actually working on work. Breakout spaces are areas outside of classrooms, and the hallways
            where students can work. The only difference between breakout rooms and breakout spaces is that one is in a room and one is not.

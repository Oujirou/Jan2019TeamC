        <p>
            Design Tech High School is a high school in Redwood Shores. It is on the Oracle campus and over 500 students go there for their education. The main draw to 
            it is the focus on design thinking that is taught to students. A typical day at the school consists of 6 period that include core classes, as well as a 
            FIT (focused indpendent time) or an elective that the students chose. There are not very many electives that are provided during normal school days: computer
            science, environmental science, and photography. Other elective courses are offered during a set of two weeks called "intersession".

        <p>
            Intersession is a dedicated where core classes do not occur, and students have two classes, a design lab which focuses on design thinking, and an exploration 
            class that provides lots of other classes offering things from mural painting to internships with companies.
